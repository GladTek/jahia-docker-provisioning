# Provisioning Examples

Starting with version 8.0.3.0, Jahia comes with a provisioning API to facilitate the orchestration of Jahia environments. Its main objective is to automate the startup of complex environment beginning with our release artifcats, going all the way to reaching production, without requiring manual actions nor direct filesystem access to the Jahia environment.

Primariraly aimed at containerized environments (Docker) this API is not tied to Docker and operate in the same fashion on a local Jahia installation.

## In this repository

Each folder in this repository contains all the necessary elements to start a Jahia environment following different use cases, these examples serves as proof-of-principles and are not meant at being used "as-is" for production environment. Instead they contain useful piece of information that can be later adapted to your use case.

Examples are sorted by complexity, with 01 being the most simple example.

## Documentation

The provisioning API is documented on the Academy [ADD LINK ONCE PUBLISHED]
